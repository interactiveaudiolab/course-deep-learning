While mean squared error performs well in a number of tasks, it is more common to use __categorical cross-entropy loss__ for multiclass classification. We can think of our network's output as a vector of ten \"class scores,\" one per digit. In training our network, our goal is to make sure that given an input image, the correct class score \"comes out on top.\" We might try to minimize the mean squared error between our network's normalized output and a __one-hot__ vector indexing the correct label\n",

        "```\n",
        "prediction = [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.1, 0.1]\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "However, this objective does not necessarily correspond to our goal of maximizing the score of the target class while keeping all other scores low. Cross entropy loss generally does a better job of capturing this objective for multiclass classification, and its use can be considered equivalent to maximum-likelihood estimation under certain assumptions. We will use PyTorch's implementation, which provides an object capable of both computing the loss on pairs of tensors and computing gradients during the backward pass. We won't go into detail here, but for more info, check out the [official documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss.html). Below, we show an example of calculating loss for a bit of made-up data.\n",

        "You might have noticed all the mentions of a `device` in the cells above. It turns out that neural networks use many operations, such as matrix multiplication, that can be efficiently parallelized and run on modern GPUs (graphics processing units, sometimes called \"video cards\"). As a result, neural network training and inference can see drastic speedups when run on a suitable GPU. PyTorch offers this option for NVIDIA-manufactured GPUs through the [CUDA platform](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/cuda.html), and provides a simple interface (`.to()`) for moving data and computation between the CPU and GPU devices. To move data to the CPU, we can call:\n",

        "In practice, running machine learning code on a GPU may require you to check your device's compatibility and install various drivers; this can be quite a hassle. Luckily, [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) provides free (albeit limited) access to GPUs in a Jupyter-like notebook environment. If you're already running this code in Colab, you can access a GPU by going to `Runtime` > `Change runtime type`, setting `Hardware accelerator` to `GPU`, and clicking `Save`. Note that this will restart the notebook, meaning you will have to run your code again.\n",

        "Below, we'll try our basic training loop again. This time, however, we'll move our network and data to the GPU, allowing for faster training and inference. While the difference between CPU and GPU may be relatively minor in this case, it can be massive for larger models and datasets."
