The course website has readings You are to submit a set of 3 single-page reactions (one reaction per item). Each reaction/review will be worth 3 points. You can review items from any week's readings, but obviously discussion in class work better if most people make most of their reviews be of items we will discuss in the next class meeting.

Hand in a pdf document that has 1 page of review per item. No more than 1 page of 11 point Times New Roman, single spaced. Demonstrating you actually read/listened/watched and thought is what will get you full points so it isn’t essential that you fill exactly one page, but if you can’t come up with at least 2/3 of a page of single-spaced 11 point text  to say in response to each thing...well....I will probably think you didn’t think too hard about it and will grade accordingly. 

For each item we’re looking for the following information.

(1) Title, author and where it was published

(2) Summary of the content

One paragraph that demonstrates that you understand the reading. Note…if I catch you cutting and pasting the abstract of a paper, you get a 0 for the review. Paraphrase in your own words. 

(3) Strengths of the paper

What good thing did you get out of the item. (a couple of paragraphs) There must be something positive you can say about having read a paper. Good idea? It taught you how to or how NOT to write a paper? Interesting problem? Good figures? You learned something? If so, what? It gave you an idea for follow up work? If it is reviewing the creative output of a system, then you can talk about what it did well when you tried it. If it is artistic output, say something about the quality and what it evokes.

(4) Major critiques

One or two paragraphs that critique assumptions, intellectual approach, analysis, suggesting improvements.
