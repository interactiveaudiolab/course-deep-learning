## Course Description 
We will study deep learning architectures: perceptrons, multi layer perceptrons, convolutional networks, recurrent neural networks (LSTMs, GRUs), Attention networks and the combination of reinforcement learning with deep learning. Other covered topics include regularization, loss functions and gradient descent. Learning will be in the practical context of implementing networks using these architectures in a modern programming environment: Pytorch. 

## Course textbook
The primary text is the [Deep Learning book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/). This reading will be supplemented by reading key papers in the field.

## Course Policies 
#### Questions outside of class
Please use [CampusWire](https://campuswire.com) for class-related questions.

#### Submitting assignments
Assignments must be submitted on the due date by the time specified on Canvas. If you are worried you can't finish on time, upload a safety submission an hour early with what you have. I will grade the most recent item submitted before the deadline. Late submissions will not be graded.

#### Grading Policy
You can earn up to 110 points. You will be graded on a 100 point scale (e.g. 93 to 100 = A, 90-92 = A-, 87-89 = B+, 83-86 = B, 80-82 = B-...and so on). 

Homework and reading assignments are solo assignments and must be original work.  

#### Free points for doing nothing at all 
Every student gets 3 points. For doing nothing. Therefore, when you look at a homework you think was graded a little low...remember, we already gave you 3 points. That likely makes up for the small thing you wish were graded differently. So maybe let it go? We already gave you the points for that, after all. 

#### Class participation for extra credit
Students can receive up to 9 points (nearly a full letter grade) of extra credit with class participation. 

*Participation during lecture* There are 30 lectures this term. You will be asked to select 3 lectures for which you will be *on-call*. In your on-call lectures, I will feel free to call on you and will expect that you've done the relevant reading prior to lecture and will be able to engage in meaningful interaction on the lecture topic. Each on-call day will be worth up to 3 points.  

No additional extra credit beyond the class participation will be provided. No requests for extra-extra credit will be considered.
